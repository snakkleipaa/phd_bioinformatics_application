# Integrated Analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq Data with Machine Learning for Predicting Drug Toxicity

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the integrated analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data using machine learning techniques to predict drug toxicity. The goal is to preprocess and analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility data to identify key features and patterns that can predict adverse drug reactions. This computational framework will be used to assess drug-related toxicity, particularly in cancer-based cohorts.

## Introduction

Drug toxicity prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical compounds. This project leverages RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) data to understand the mechanisms of drug action and identify potential toxic effects. By integrating these omics data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build predictive models for drug toxicity.

## Objectives

- Preprocess RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data.
- Perform integrated analysis to identify key features related to drug toxicity.
- Develop machine learning models to predict adverse drug reactions.
- Validate the models using cancer-based cohort data.
